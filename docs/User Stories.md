## User1:
The traffic is always jammed on rush hour and it can last for hours, so everyone is forced to go ahead of time to avoid it.
My schedule is so tight that I cannot go in advance so usually I got caught in the traffic jam.
I hope there will be a way to solve this problem so I will not be late again.

## User2:
There has been a bunch of accident on the crossroad.
Luckily until this time, there is no casualty at all.
However, we do not want to wait until it happens so it will be very useful if we have either police or traffic light to manage the traffic on every crossroads and also speed limitation for the roads.

## User3:
In the rush hour, a path on the crossroad can get blocked by vehicle from other path.
Usually it caused traffic jam on roads that are connected to the blocked path.
Once you are caught in the jam, there is nothing you can do because there is no other way that leads to the same direction except that road.
It will be nice if there are some kinds of rules that can manage the crossroad.

## User4:
Some road has a bunch of holes and some are uneven.
However, there are also smooth road as some of them has been repaired.
Driver that does not live nearby the road may not know this and they might drive in high speed without knowing the condition of the other road.
So we need a speed limit sign on every road to keep the safety of the driver and others in the surrounding area.
